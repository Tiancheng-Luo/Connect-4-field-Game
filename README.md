# Connect-4-field-Game
Developed a multi-player game using Java, Multi-threading, TCP and a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Each player entered their individual game pieces on an inverted trapezoidal board-like UI to form a pattern along a direction. The game could be played over a LAN or as a single player against the computer.
